## ü§î **What is MLOps?**

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of integrating machine learning (ML) system development and operations. It ensures that ML models are:

- Reproducible
- Scalable
- Reliable
- Efficient

---

## üí° **Why MLOps?**

- **Streamlined Workflows:** Automate and manage ML pipelines effectively.
- **Scalability:** Deploy ML models to production at scale.
- **Collaboration:** Enhance collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and retrain models to maintain performance.

---

## üîë **Key Concepts**

- **Model Lifecycle Management:** Tracking and managing the lifecycle of an ML model.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automating code and model deployments.
- **Feature Engineering:** Building reusable and scalable feature stores.
- **Model Monitoring:** Observing model behavior and detecting performance degradation.
- **Data Versioning:** Tracking changes in datasets.
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Using tools like Terraform and Kubernetes.
